## How to install the custom package `adafnnresearch`

This is for my (Nicholas') reference.

- Make sure `../AdaFNN_research/` is a directory.
- If poetry shell isn't installed:
> poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
- Then activate the environment:
> poetry shell
- Install the library in editable mode to constantly check for changes:
> pip install -e ../AdaFNN_research/
