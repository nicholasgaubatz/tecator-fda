# tecator-fda
A functional data analysis of the [Tecator meat sample data set](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/tecator). Here, X has shape (215, 100) and contains near infrared absorbance spectrum information for different wavelengths, while y has shape (215, 1) and contains fat content for each meat sample. In particular, we compare OLS, ridge regression, and functional linear regression.
